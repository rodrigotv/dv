Daniela has gained in-depth experience during her twenty-five-year career working mostly with women, as they represent most of the beneficiaries she had worked with. Her experience also includes working with native populations, often a focus in women’s development in rural and urban areas that demonstrate substantial needs such as organizational development and adult learning methodologies.

Those projects were successful mainly due to the development of a variety of training materials supported by visuals and case studies sensitive to the reality and needs of each woman's initiative. The programs also took into account the different formats and timing women need to be engaged in training due to their household needs, especially in rural areas.  

**Some experiences:**

Provides guidelines for improving the existing products and gives some ideas for products in different categories and price points that the artisan can explore in order to diversify and raise their income. 

**Afghan Women Design Center**. Working with young women in difficult environments such as Afghanistan was an important challenge for Daniela. The Design Center, was a project from Aid to Artisans aiming to provide Afghan women entrepreneurs with trends information, cultural research and training programs so they improve their access to the market, the quality and innovation of their products and their own development as entrepreneurs. Daniela was in charge of developing the training programs, working directly with women in the technical aspects of production as well as business and marketing needs for their small businesses. 

**A Design Mentoring Program** was also developed and directed to young women in Kabul in order to provide them with the proper tools for working in design and product development as junior designers in a country that didn't have any design programs in universities. The consultant designed and developed the complete 18-month curriculum and competences for the program; the selection criteria for women between 18 and 22 years old, the interviews to the young applicants and gave the training for the first part for the program preparing the teachers.
