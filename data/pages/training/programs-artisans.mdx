## Artisans Advanced Program

The advance program starts with an artisan assessment, a local market assessment and analysis and an assessment into the group’s cultural heritage.  The training programs are longer and include in-depth topics related to leadership, organizational development, financial management, marketing and sales strategy.   Product design and development may vary from the design of product lines for each artisan to the development of an entire collection. Marketing strategy includes the collection’s launch and exhibition. It allows artisans to revive or to develop their own cultural features as an inspiration for their production, to have a deeper understanding of overall quality and to appreciate the power of design and innovation, all-important tools for growing their small enterprises and achieving higher prices in new markets. The program may lead to the creation of associations among artisan’s groups, collective sales strategies, and retail initiatives depending on each project’s length and resources.
