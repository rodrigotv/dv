## CULTURAL HERITAGE AND RESEARCH

The cultural aspect of handcraft production is the core of Daniela’s product development process. This stems from her professional experience but also from her background as a Textile Designer and Andean Weaving Expert. She has actively participated in a number of projects related to cultural heritage working alongside experts in the field which includes creating a cultural department within the Jalsuri Foundation directed by one of Bolivia’s most prestigious historians. This program may develop the creation of a national cultural archive for the organization, company or country.

## BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT – LOCAL AND INTERNATIONAL

Daniela developed marketing and sales retail strategies as part of her artisan´s training program and has continued to perfect them over the years.This culminated in the creation of a chain of stores in different locations in her country sponsoring seventy-four artisan groups that averaged between 900 and 2,500 products per store exhibition. Her application of a careful merchandising strategy based on an up-to-date market analysis, product design, accurate pricing, and artful exhibition design has proved highly successful in sales and provides a much needed experience to the artisans into their path to exports. Business strategies for international markets include assessment, specialized training and product development for exports. Her experience in international trade fairs and negotiating with international clients is an asset to her training program.
