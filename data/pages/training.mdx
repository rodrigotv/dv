All training programs start with an assessment of the organization or artisan group, their cultural background and the markets in which they sell. At the same time, the consultant considers how the program’s training methodologies, contents and commercial activities fit into an overall framework, ultimately ensuring the project’s utmost impact and long-term sustainability.  

Components of the Training Programs:

## ASSESSMENT

This is the first activity and is basically an evaluation the consultant conducts in the location with the organization staff or each artisan in a group. It is an individual conversation with relevant information that includes years of experience working in a particular skill/trade, production management, innovation and business practices. This activity also includes Market and Cultural assessments.

    ]
  }
/>

## CULTURAL IDENTITY

Cultural identity is the soul of a handmade product.  Many countries have not documented the traditional heritage of their handmade products and, if so, the information has not been made available. Artisans working in urban areas where the greatest loss of handcraft technical knowledge occur, often do not have a clear reference of the country’s cultural traditions. Cultural research comprises an essential part of any design intervention.

## DESIGN

All training programs include a design approach and various design disciplines: Research of international trend information, analysis and preparation of annual market trends. Product Development and Design: Directed to all trades and materials, the process includes technical assistance and research. Collaboration: The methodology is focused on creating new designs guided by the collaborative work between each artisan and the consultant creating. Exhibition Design: All products are developed in lines that will look great together and will be presented in a high-quality exhibition. Graphics and Branding are important components of a competitive marketing vision for the new creations. Special programs may include design topics as color theory, fashion, embellishments, design for specific raw materials, cultural features and trades as well as longer in-depth programs such as a Design Mentoring Program for Artisans.

## BUSINESS AND MARKETING

Selling is as important as producing. Often sales are seen as secondary with the result that product development’s full potential is not exploited. A project or an artisan group that creates appealing products but are selling on the street or in fairs often faces a constant drop in the product’s perceived value due to insufficient marketing practices. Business and marketing training presents important concepts and tools that allow the artisans to be more competitive, sell at better prices and understand markets with a strategic mindset.

## ORGANIZATIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND LEADERSHIP

Artisan organizations rhhusually face problems organizing themselves. Leaders often struggle with the administration of the business. Cultural idiosyncrasies and the lack of a strategic vision can make those challenges even bigger. These topics are important to address and cope for any organization to be competitive. The consultant provides a strategic vision for the business where leadership and planning are analyzed taking into account the story, special needs and characteristics of each organization.
