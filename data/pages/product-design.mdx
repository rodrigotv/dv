For Daniela Product Development (PD) and Design process also aims for cultural preservation and the need to protect, restore, and honor all forms of traditions. The skills of the artisans are a crucial factor as well as market trends information, cultural inspiration and available raw materials.

The designer creates new visual solutions and designs by experimenting with concepts, techniques, colors and embellishments in a collaborative work with each artisan. This results in original product creations across different categories and families, a signature collection that represents the community or country.
