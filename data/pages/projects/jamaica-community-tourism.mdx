The structural framework for the program was to deliver a concentrated and comprehensive training package that would positively influence the production and delivery of high quality craft items in the communities of Bluefields and Treasure Beach. 

Each artisan received at least two hours of one-on-one design and product development support with focus on their existing design and on new designs based on their technical abilities and market trends.

Training contents were designed for the specific needs of each group and individual artisan which included the challenges that artisans face to reach the tourist market and actually make sales in fair prices, the challenges with raw material and components provision and the importance of planning and goal setting for the small business.
