## Creating a cultural department for historical research in handmade production. 

Jalsuri created a cultural department lead by prestigious historian Silvia Arze that sought to preserve Bolivia’s important heritage information and use it as a source of inspiration for the product development process while highlighting the origins and value of the country’s historical skills through labeling and organized into a core cultural compendium.

Daniela invited Bolivian designers Andres Palacios and Lidia Macaya to be part of the Design & Creative Development team. Together they created 138 product lines generating more than 500 new products subsequently sold in Jalsuri Stores benefiting 46 artisan groups. Another 28 groups were selected to be sold with the Jalsuri Collection.

## Creating opportunities for all sizes of artisan groups through retail marketing. Jalsuri Stores.

The Jalsuri chain of stores benefited these artisan groups with more than $140,000 yearly sales in a country where by that time 80% of the population lived with less than two dollars a day.
