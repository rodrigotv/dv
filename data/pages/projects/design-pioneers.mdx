## Design Pioneers, Bolivia
### Funded by USAID
###Design Director, Aid to Artisans BOLIVIA

Developing a local market for artisans through high-end retail. Bolivia

Several Bolivian small artisan businesses were unable to join Aid to Artisan’s activities in international trade fairs due to their limited export experience and production capacities in quantities, price points, raw materials provision, standardization and other challenges.  

Therefore, Daniela and her team developed a concept of high-end exhibitions featuring high-quality products targeting international residents and tourists in the local market in order to enhanced buyer perception towards handmade products and help local artisans sell in better prices.
