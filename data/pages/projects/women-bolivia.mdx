## Women in Rural Development, Bolivia
### Funded by CODESPA, Spain.
### Product Designer & Trainer

Women producer micro-enterprises. Community tourism market development through training and product design.

Lake Titicaca, a densely visited tourism destination in Bolivia, was the focus of small community tourism efforts where the native population from Challapampa, Coati and Sahuiña communities was previously trained in hospitality and bed & breakfast management. The program added a component focus in traditional and non-traditional handmade products made by women.

In rural areas where traditional practices are part of the national heritage it is important to base any program on the community’s known customs and skills and then training will present new notions as market-driven products that follow global trends while simultaneously maintaining its cultural identity.

New products developed for the tourism market were produced using traditional woven textiles made with natural dyes, traditional macramé, and doll-making techniques.

Rural projects require taking development efforts in small steps in order to gain trust from communities and to achieve impacts from the application of new approaches that need time to be consolidated.

New training need a learning curve before finally becoming an efficient tool enhancing their livelihoods.

The sales for the three communities improved considerably after the project. The most important challenge for producers was to learn to work together instead of operating as individual sellers in the islands.
