The cultural and personal background of each artisan is the true story of a handmade object, its soul. I have been looking for strategies to preserve the mediums and promote the cultural expressions reflected in each artisan´s production process and final product since beginning my career in 1996. 

My experiences with talented producers in my country and internationally allowed me to develop a specialized model of work which has proven successful in several countries and benefited hundreds of artisans.
